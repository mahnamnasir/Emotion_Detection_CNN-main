# Emotion Detection CNN
 A Python script that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect emotions in facial in an image or video.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV Python (cv2) library
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library

## Installation
To use Emotion Detection CNN, you first need to install the required libraries. You can install TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib using pip by running the following command:
```sh
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```
Alternatively, you can install these libraries via conda using the following command:
```sh
conda install tensorflow keras opencv numpy matplotlib

```
After installing the required libraries, you can download or clone the Emotion Detection CNN script from this GitHub repository.

## Usage
To use Emotion Detection CNN, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```sh
python emotion_detection_cnn.py
```
Emotion Detection CNN will use your computer's webcam to capture images and detect emotions in real-time. The script will display the image with the detected emotion labeled above the face.

## Output
Emotion Detection CNN will label each detected face with one of the following emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral.
